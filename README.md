# Car Market Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This project involves a data analysis of the automotive market, specifically segmenting car sales based on vehicle horsepower and make. The goal is to identify customer preferences, market trends, and provide data-driven recommendations for business strategy and marketing plans. The analysis focuses on understanding the differences between high-volume, low-horsepower segments and low-volume, high-horsepower luxury segments.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:

*   `Autodataset`: The raw dataset used for the analysis.
*   `mymarketing.py`: The Python script used for data processing, analysis, and generating the visualizations.
*   `Marketing Project.pptx`:The presentation file summarizing the project's findings and strategic recommendations for stakeholders.

## Methodology
The analysis involved:

1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning**: The CSV data was loaded and pre-processed in Python.
2.  **Segmentation**: Cars were segmented into low, medium, and high horsepower groups.
3.  **Visualization**: Bar charts and scatter plots were generated to visualize sales counts by make, horsepower ranges, and price correlations.
4.  **Insights & Recommendations**: Key insights were extracted regarding fuel efficiency preferences, brand dominance (Toyota), and the nature of the luxury car market (Porsche, Jaguar).
