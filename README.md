# Car Market Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This project involves a data analysis of the automotive market, specifically segmenting car sales based on vehicle horsepower and make. The goal is to identify customer preferences, market trends, and provide data-driven recommendations for business strategy and marketing plans. The analysis focuses on understanding the differences between high-volume, low-horsepower segments and low-volume, high-horsepower luxury segments.
Although the dataset is limited, this project demonstrates **end-to-end data analysis skills** including data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and insight generation using Python.

## Methodology
The analysis involved:
1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning**: The CSV data was loaded and pre-processed in Python.
2.  **Segmentation**: Market segmentation based on:
- Vehicle type
- Brand
- Fuel type
- Visual analysis to identify trends and patterns
3.  **Visualization**: Bar charts and scatter plots were generated to visualize sales counts by make, horsepower ranges, and price correlations.
4.  **Insights & Recommendations**: Key insights were extracted regarding fuel efficiency preferences, brand dominance (Toyota), and the nature of the luxury car market (Porsche, Jaguar).

Key observations:
The price distribution is right-skewed (positively skewed).
Most used cars are concentrated in the lower to mid-price range.
